# workingWebsiteChecker
From your list of websites in a text file separated by new lines, tells you the ones can successfully be accessed and therefore are still probably online (have a HTTP code of 200 OK success status response)

Sample use case: you have a long list of websites in a text file, but you only want a list of the websites that are still "working" (can be accessed online by anybody).
